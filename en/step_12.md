# Challenge: Add custom sensors

Now you've got a Weather Station up and running, why not add some more sensors? You have 7 free pins on the MCP3008 ADC so you incorporate more analog sensors.

How about a light meter or UV sensor? How could you keep it watertight?

Or maybe you could add a lightning detector - there are a few commercial boards available.
