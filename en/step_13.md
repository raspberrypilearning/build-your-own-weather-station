## Challenge: add custom sensors
- Now you've got your weather station up and running, why not add some more sensors? You have seven free pins on the MCP3008 ADC, so you could incorporate more analog sensors!

- How about a light meter or UV sensor? How could you keep it watertight?

- Or maybe you could add a lightning detector â€” there are a few commercial boards available for doing this.
