## Air quality

The original Oracle Raspberry Pi Weather Station kit used a Figaro TGS2600 sensor for air quality measurements. The batch of devices installed on the Weather Station HAT have worked well, but we've noticed that many of the ones we've tested recently have been very difficult to calibrate and have produced contradictory readings. They're fine if you want to detect a general change in the local gases (for example to build a [fart detector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/fart-detector){:target="_blank"}), but we do not currently recommend them for use in a custom weather station.

We are continuing to evaluate low-cost air quality sensors and will update this guide as soon as we find one we're happy with.
