## Active mechanical sensors

So far all the sensors you've used have been passive electronic sensors that just sit there are measure their surroundings. However to measure things like rainfall and wind speed/direction, you'll need to use active mechanical devices that interact physically with the environment.

The original Oracle Weather Station kit used popular [wind and rain sensors] (https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=145){:target="_blank"} that are often used in consumer weather stations. These are the recommended sensors to use as they are robust and reliable. The [datasheet](https://www.argentdata.com/files/80422_datasheet.pdf){:target="_blank"} for these sensors gives more information about their size and construction.

### Connectors

These sensors usually come with RJ11 connectors (they look like a standard telephone jack) which are sturdy and are difficult to accidentally dislodge so your Weather Station will remain operational even in blustery conditions.
