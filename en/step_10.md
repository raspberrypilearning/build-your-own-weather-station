## Fully functional weather station

You should now have working weather station prototype on breadboard. This is perfect for testing but probably not suitable for long-term, reliable installation outside.

To modify this so that it will survive outdoors for a long period you will need to make more permanent connections. This will involve some soldering, but don't worry if you've never soldered before - there is a [great blog post and movie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/getting-started-soldering/){:target="_blank"} to get you up to speed.

## Powering your Weather Station

## Keeping your weather station dry

This is really important. If the Pi or any of the electronics gets wet or even very damp, they will fail or start to corrode. The Oracle Weather Station uses a small weatherproof enclosure to house the external environmental sensors. The key idea is to allow outside air to flow around the sensors but to prevent moisture from reaching them
